# About Me

Hi, I’m Tornam 👋  
A Software Engineer with a passion for building things that make life a little easier (or at least more interesting).

I enjoy solving problems—whether that’s debugging a tricky piece of code, optimizing algorithms, or figuring out how to make the perfect cup of coffee while waiting for code to compile.

## What I Do

- **Code**: Fluent in Python, JavaScript, Java and I speak fluent semicolon.
- **Develop**: Web apps, software, and the occasional “why not” side projects.
- **Learn**: Constantly leveling up. Whether it's a new framework, language, or tech trend, I'm all about staying sharp.
- **Collaborate**: I believe the best solutions come from good teamwork and the occasional meme exchange.

## Interests & Hobbies

- Open-source projects and contributing to cool ideas.
- Exploring new technologies (even the overhyped ones—looking at you, AI).
- Gaming, because who doesn’t love a good strategy session? (FIFA)
- Learning how to balance too many tabs without crashing (browser or brain).
